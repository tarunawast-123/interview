# InterviewBytes
This is a web app for helping students of NITJ to gauge the level of preparation required to crack any company which visits the campus.

Any student of NITJ who gets placed or bags internship through college will post his/her interview experience along with their resume so that students of future batches
can access their experience and be ultra ready for that company.

Also students can further communicate with the seniors on the platform itself for further guidance.
